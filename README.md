# Temperature Analysis by Local Climate Zones (LCZ) - Lajeado, RS

Visualization and simulation system for temperature based on Local Climate Zones (LCZ) for the city of Lajeado, Rio Grande do Sul.

## üìã Overview

This project allows you to:

- **Visualize local climate zones (LCZ)** mapped for Lajeado-RS
- **Retrieve real-time temperature data** via the Meteomatics API
- **Simulate scenarios** of land use change and its thermal impacts
- **Calculate temperature differences** when converting one LCZ to another

## üå°Ô∏è What are Local Climate Zones (LCZ)?

Local Climate Zones are a standardized classification of urban and rural areas based on their thermal properties, developed by Stewart & Oke (2012). The system defines 17 types of zones:

### Urban Zones (LCZ 1‚Äì10)

- **LCZ 1‚Äì3**: Compact High/Mid/Low-Rise (dense buildings)
- **LCZ 4‚Äì6**: Open High/Mid/Low-Rise (spaced buildings)
- **LCZ 7**: Lightweight Low-Rise (light structures)
- **LCZ 8**: Large Low-Rise (large low buildings)
- **LCZ 9**: Sparsely Built (sparse constructions)
- **LCZ 10**: Heavy Industry

### Natural Zones (LCZ 11‚Äì17)

- **LCZ 11‚Äì13**: Dense/Scattered Trees, Bushes
- **LCZ 14**: Low Plants ‚Äì **temperature baseline**
- **LCZ 15**: Bare Rock or Paved
- **LCZ 16**: Bare Soil or Sand
- **LCZ 17**: Water

## üî¨ Temperature Calculation Methodology

### Baseline and Thermal Offsets

The calculation methodology is based on the LCZ framework (Stewart & Oke, 2012) and systematic reviews on Urban Heat Island (UHI):

**LCZ 14 (Low Plants)** is used as the baseline (offset = 0¬∞C).

Each LCZ has a **characteristic thermal offset**:

| LCZ | Type                 | Thermal Offset | Scientific Basis                                  |
| --- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Compact High-Rise    | +2.5¬∞C         | Studies show values between +2.0 and +3.0¬∞C       |
| 2   | Compact Mid-Rise     | +2.8¬∞C         | Identified as the hottest LCZ in multiple studies |
| 3   | Compact Low-Rise     | +2.3¬∞C         | Typical range +2.0 to +2.5¬∞C                      |
| 4   | Open High-Rise       | +1.8¬∞C         | Lower density = lower heating                     |
| 5   | Open Mid-Rise        | +2.0¬∞C         | Significant UHI contributor                       |
| 6   | Open Low-Rise        | +1.5¬∞C         | Moderate heating                                  |
| 7   | Lightweight Low-Rise | +1.2¬∞C         | Light materials = less heat retention             |
| 8   | Large Low-Rise       | +2.2¬∞C         | Large built mass                                  |
| 9   | Sparsely Built       | +0.5¬∞C         | Minimal urban heating                             |
| 10  | Heavy Industry       | +2.6¬∞C         | High anthropogenic heat                           |
| 11  | Dense Trees          | -1.5¬∞C         | Strong cooling via evapotranspiration             |
| 12  | Scattered Trees      | -0.8¬∞C         | Moderate cooling                                  |
| 13  | Bush/Scrub           | -0.3¬∞C         | Slight cooling                                    |
| 14  | Low Plants           | 0.0¬∞C          | **BASELINE**                                      |
| 15  | Bare Rock/Paved      | +2.0¬∞C         | High heat absorption                              |
| 16  | Bare Soil/Sand       | +1.0¬∞C         | Moderate heating                                  |
| 17  | Water                | -2.0¬∞C         | Strong cooling due to high thermal capacity       |

### Calculation Formula

When an area is converted from LCZ A to LCZ B:

```
ŒîT = Offset_LCZ_B - Offset_LCZ_A
T_new = T_current + ŒîT
```

**Example:**

- Current area: LCZ 3 (Compact Low-Rise), Temperature = 28¬∞C
- Conversion to: LCZ 11 (Dense Trees)
- ŒîT = (-1.5¬∞C) - (+2.3¬∞C) = -3.8¬∞C
- T\_new = 28¬∞C - 3.8¬∞C = **24.2¬∞C**
